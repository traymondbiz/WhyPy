you can check september 2017 for load old data feature as a test.

I am aware of some errors that I'm too lazy to change right now,
including division error where it'll go to 11 decimal places for some reason,
and also how the item names will collide with each other if they are too
long or there is too many.

Also I found about 7 errors while trying to compile this thing that I have
fixed.

yeaaa
