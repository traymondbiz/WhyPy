CPSC 599 SAMPLE
-----
Two datathons have been included in the repository.
They consist of the works of Professor Wesley Willett, and my colleagues in the course.

IntroToAnaconda
-----
An introductory Anaconda workbook that showcases some things can be done in Jupyter.
It also shows the value of Data Science and the Anscombe data file.

SnekChek
-----
Code used to write to the CSUS spreadsheet.
It's rather useless since you (hopefully) don't know the credentials to the mailing list.
Also, the spreadsheet has been removed for privacy reasons.
